# ðŸ“– Ubiquitous Language

In order to describe how `@qphi/publisher-subscriber` works, some words with strong semantic will be used. This section provide the right meaning of each words for the following documentations. 

## Subscriber
Instances that can subscribe to any *notifcation* from *publisher*. Subscriber is one of the two roles currently available in this communication pattern.
<br/>
<br/>
**Implementation detail**: 
* `SubscriberInterface` and `PublisherSubscriberInterface` describe this role.
* `Subscriber` and `PublisherSubscriber` classes implement this behavior.

## Publisher
Instances that can publish any *notifcation* to *subscriber*. Publisher is one of the two roles currently available in this communication pattern.
<br/>
<br/>
**implementation detail**:
* `PublisherInterface` and `PublisherSubscriberInterface` describe this role.
* `Publisher` and `PublisherSubscriber` classes implement this behavior.

## Notification

Is the name given to the message published by publisher. When a subscriber subscribe to publisher, it subscribes to a notification publisher by this publisher.

**implementation detail**:
* it's just a string.

## Subscription

Contract between publisher and subscriber for a given notification. A subscription item contains a handler which is trigger each time publisher publish the related notification.

**implementation detail**:
* `SubscriptionInterface` describe this data structure.

## Component

Generic term that refers to any instance that can be subscriber, publisher, or both.

## Workflow

Complex behavior that can **emerge** from chained publication.

Example:

```js
a.subscribe('first-step', root, () => {
    // ...
    a.publish('second-step');
});

b.subscribe('second-step', a, () => {
    // ...
    b.publish('third-step');
});

c.subscribe('third-step', c, () => {
    // ...
    // end of workflow
});

root.publish('firt-step');
```

Here, we can refer to behavior involved by ``first-step``,``second-step`` and ``third-step`` as a *workflow*.
